# VCable - Virtual Cable

Virtual Cable is a IoT platform for bridging the Ethernet Port of Raspberry PIs to create a virtual network link between two device.

For bridging we are using [OpenVPN](https://www.openvpn.org) and 
[Bridge Control](https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation/miscellaneous/76-ethernet-bridging.html).
